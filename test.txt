Recursion occurs when the definition of a concept or process depends on a simpler or previous version of itself.[1] Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

A process that exhibits recursion is recursive.

In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibits recursive behavior when it can be defined by two properties:

    A simple base case (or cases) — a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
    A recursive step — a set of rules that reduces all successive cases toward the base case.

For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestor. One's ancestor is either:

    One's parent (base case), or
    One's parent's ancestor (recursive step).

The Fibonacci sequence is another classic example of recursion:

    Fib(0) = 0 as base case 1,

    Fib(1) = 1 as base case 2,
